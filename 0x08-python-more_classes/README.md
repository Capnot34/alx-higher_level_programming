### Tasks 🛠️

1. **Simple rectangle**: Define an empty class that represents a rectangle.
    - [Code here](./0-rectangle.py)

2. **Real definition of a rectangle**: Enhance the rectangle with width and height.
    - [Code here](./1-rectangle.py)

3. **Area and Perimeter**: Compute area and perimeter for the rectangle.
    - [Code here](./2-rectangle.py)

4. **String representation**: Offer a way to visually represent the rectangle using `#`.
    - [Code here](./3-rectangle.py)

5. **Eval is magic**: Modify the representation to enable recreation using `eval()`.
