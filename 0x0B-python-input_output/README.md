## 🎩 About the Project 

In this project, we'll be dealing with:
- Opening, reading, and writing files in Python 📁
- Serializing and deserializing data, especially using the JSON format 🔁
- Exception handling while working with files 🚫🔥
- And a lot more about the file I/O in Python 🐍

## 📋 🧩Tasks 📋

Here are some of the challenges in this project:

0. **Read File**: Write a function to read the content of a file.
1. **Write to a File**: Create a function that writes a string to a text file.
2. **Append to a File**: Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file.
3. **To JSON String**: Create a function to get the JSON representation of a Python object.
4. **From JSON String to Object**: Design a function that converts a JSON string to a Python object.
5. **Save Object to File**: Implement a function that saves a Python object to a file using JSON representation.
6. **Create object from a JSON file**: Write a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”.
7. **Load, add, save**: Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file.
8. **Class to JSON**: Write a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object.
9. **Student to JSON**: Write a class Student that defines a student.
10. **Student to JSON with filter**: Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 9-student.py).
11. **Student to disk and reload**: Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 10-student.py).
12. **Pascal's Triangle**: Technical interview preparation.
13. **Search and update**: Write a function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string.
