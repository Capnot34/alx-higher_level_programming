# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects üêç

Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) principles are a fundamental concept that every developer should grasp. This repository contains solutions to tasks that dive deep into classes, objects, and their associated functionalities in Python.

## üìÅ Files & Descriptions

### [0. My first square](./0-square.py)
- An empty class that defines a square.

### [1. Square with size](./1-square.py)
- A class `Square` that possesses a private instance attribute `size`.

### [2. Size validation](./2-square.py)
- Enhances the previous task by adding value validations for `size`.

### [3. Area of a square](./3-square.py)
- Further builds upon the `Square` class to include a method that calculates its area.

### [4. Access and update private attribute](./4-square.py)
- Illustrates how to safely access and set the value of the private attribute `__size`.

### [5. Printing a square](./5-square.py)
- Demonstrates the power of defining custom behaviors for built-in operations.

### [6. Coordinates of a square](./6-square.py)
- Expands the `Square` class to have a `position` attribute, introducing multi-attribute management.
